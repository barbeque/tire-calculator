Tire Calculator
===
A client-side Javascript tire size (diameter) calculator which lets you figure out how far your
speedometer will be off by running non-factory sized tires.

To use:
1. Find your stock tire size. Enter it in "original tire size."
1. Find the tire size your want to compare it to. Enter it in the "new tire size" box.
1. Press compare.

The general rule of thumb for safety is to stay within 3% of the original speedometer value.
